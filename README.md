Hello,

My name is Khang Nguyen. I am freshed to Github. I am trying to learn it as well as Java coding. Learning to code in Java is excited because it has so many things to learn about it.
I love to play soccer as my hobby beside leanring new technologies ( on PluralSight, Revature and Cave of Programming). I am on a Java project with Revature Pro (PubHub 100 peoject) which I need to refresh my memory.
